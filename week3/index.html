                <aside>
                    C-3PO is a protocol droid specializing in human-cyborg relations. He was constructed by Anakin Skywalker prior to the year <time>32 BBY (Before the Battle of Yavin)</time>.
                </aside>
                <p>Star Wars, the Rise of Skywalker, is my absolute favorite Star Wars movie. This is because it heavily features the very best droid of all time: C-3PO.</p>
                <p>C-3PO is and has always been voiced by <div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">Anthony Daniels (<a name="itemprop" href="https://twitter.com/ADaniels3PO" itemprop="url">@ADaniels3PO</a>)</div>.</p>

                <h3>The Movie Trailer</h3>
                <video name="video" width="320" height="240" controls="controls">
                    <source src="images/trailer.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
                    Your browser does not support the video element.
                </video>            
                 <p>As you can see, this is not the whole trailer for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. However, it is far and away the most important part. In this trailer, C-3PO is made to sound as though he is about to die. This is why, presumably, he is taking one last look at all of his friends! The rest of the trailer is cool, but I just think it's most important that we know what is up with our favorite protocol droid at all times.</p>

                    <p>C-3P0 doesn't die! I thought that he would, but he doesn't.</p>
